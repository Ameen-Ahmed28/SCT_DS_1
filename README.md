**Student Performance Analysis: Visualizing Reading Score Trends  **

This project analyzes the distribution of reading scores among students using a histogram.The analysis and visualization were conducted in Google Colab using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas to create a histogram that groups reading scores into ranges and displays their frequency.  

The visualization highlights trends in reading performance, such as the most common score ranges and variations among students. This task improved my skills in using Python for data analysis and visualization while emphasizing the importance of visual tools in evaluating academic outcomes.  

Tools used: Google Colab 
Key takeaway: Histograms, created programmatically, provide powerful insights into data distribution and trends in reading scores.
